 # HELLO THERE 👋
 My name is Daroshum Jawed, a passionate hairdresser with a keen eye for style and a love for all things hair. 💇‍♀️ As someone deeply passionate about the art of hairstyling, I've spent years honing my craft and helping my clients look and feel their best. My journey in the world of hairdressing began at a young age, inspired by the creativity and transformation that comes with styling hair. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working in top salons, attending cutting-edge workshops, and collaborating with talented stylists from around the world. Each experience has deepened my passion for the art of hairstyling and fueled my desire to push the boundaries of creativity. But that's not all there is to me! In addition to my love for hairdressing, I'm also embarking on an exciting journey as a web developer student. 🖥️ I'm currently diving into the world of coding, eager to explore the endless possibilities of web development and design. When I'm not behind the chair or glued to my computer screen, you can find me experimenting with new hairstyles, exploring the latest trends in hair and fashion, or immersing myself in the vibrant culture of the salon community. Join me on this exciting journey as I blend creativity, technical skill, and a touch of magic to bring beauty and innovation to life! ✨
