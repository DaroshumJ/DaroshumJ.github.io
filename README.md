 # About Me

My name is Daroshum Jawed, a passionate hairdresser with a keen eye for style and a love for all things hair. üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As someone deeply passionate about the art of hairstyling, I've spent years honing my craft and helping my clients look and feel their best.

## My Hairdressing Journey

My journey in the world of hairdressing began at a young age, inspired by the creativity and transformation that comes with styling hair. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working in top salons, attending cutting-edge workshops, and collaborating with talented stylists from around the world. Each experience has deepened my passion for the art of hairstyling and fueled my desire to push the boundaries of creativity.

## My Journey as a Web Developer Student

## Beyond the Chair and Computer Screen
